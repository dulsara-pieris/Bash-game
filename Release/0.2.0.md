# Release 0.2.0 - Modular Architecture

**Release Date:** January 11, 2026  
**Type:** Minor Release  
**Status:** Stable

---

## 🎯 Overview

Version 0.2.0 represents a major architectural improvement to Star Runner. The entire codebase has been refactored into a modular structure, making the game significantly more maintainable, testable, and extensible while maintaining full backwards compatibility.

---

## ✨ What's New

### Modular Architecture
The game has been completely reorganized into 13 focused modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the game:

#### Core Modules
- **config.sh** - All constants, colors, and terminal setup
- **utils.sh** - Helper functions (random numbers, ownership checks, exit handler)
- **profile.sh** - Player profile creation, loading, and saving

#### Game Systems
- **ships.sh** - Ship definitions and stats (5 ships)
- **skins.sh** - Skin customization system (5 skins)
- **entities.sh** - Asteroids, crystals, and powerups
- **weapons.sh** - Laser firing and combat mechanics
- **collision.sh** - Collision detection and game over handling
- **effects.sh** - Powerup timers and temporary effects

#### User Interface
- **render.sh** - All drawing functions (ship, HUD, borders, stars)
- **input.sh** - Keyboard input handling
- **menu.sh** - Main menu, stats, help, and update system
- **shop.sh** - Hangar and skin shop

#### Main Entry Point
- **game.sh** - Streamlined main game loop that orchestrates all modules

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Maintainability:** Much easier to locate and fix bugs
- **Readability:** Main game loop reduced from 1000+ lines to ~170 lines
- **Reusability:** Functions can be easily shared across modules
- **Testability:** Individual modules can be tested in isolation
- **Scalability:** Adding new features (ships, weapons, powerups) is straightforward

### Performance
- No performance impact - same game loop efficiency
- Identical runtime behavior
- All functions loaded at startup via `source` commands

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

### No Changes
All gameplay remains identical to 0.1.1:
- Same controls and mechanics
- Same ships, skins, and powerups
- Same scoring and progression
- Same profile system

### Full Backwards Compatibility
- Existing player profiles work without modification
- All saved data (high scores, crystals, owned items) preserved
- No user action required for upgrade

---

## 🚀 Benefits for Players

### Stability
- Cleaner code means fewer bugs
- Easier to maintain and update
- Better testing capabilities

### Future Development
- Faster feature additions
- More reliable updates
- Easier community contributions

---

## 🛠️ Benefits for Developers

### Easier Debugging
- Know exactly where each feature lives
- Can isolate and test individual systems
- Clear error tracking

### Better Collaboration
- Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously
- Clear module boundaries prevent conflicts
- Easier code review process

### Faster Feature Development
Examples of what's now easier:
- Add new ship: Just update `ships.sh`
- Add new powerup: Modify `entities.sh` and `collision.sh`
- Change UI: Update `render.sh` or `menu.sh`
- Add new weapon type: Edit `weapons.sh`

## 📦 Installation

### New Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/star-runner.git
cd star-runner
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Upgrade from 0.1.x
```bash
# From within the game
# Main Menu → [5] Update

# Or manually
cd /usr/local/share/Star-runner
git pull origin main
```

Your profile and all data will be preserved automatically.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

No bug fixes in this release - purely architectural improvements.

---

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

**None.** This release is fully backwards compatible with 0.1.x.

---

## 📋 Migration Guide

### For Players
No action needed. Just update and play!

### For Developers/Contributors
If you have a fork or custom modifications:

1. **Understand the new structure:** Review the module organization
2. **Move your changes:** Map your modifications to the appropriate modules
3. **Test thoroughly:** Ensure all functionality works in the new structure
4. **Update documentation:** If you maintain custom docs, update file paths

---

## 📝 Notes

### Module Loading Order
Modules are loaded in dependency order:
1. config.sh (required by all)
2. utils.sh (required by many)
3. profile.sh (uses utils)
4. ships.sh & skins.sh (data definitions)
5. Remaining modules (game systems)

### Variable Scope
- Global variables used for game state (shared across modules)
- Local variables used within functions
- Clear documentation of which modules read/write which variables
